Assignment
There are several subparts:
• Plan the structure of your site. For example:
– description and history
– links to specification, documentation, manuals, and tutorials
– available translators and installation instructions
– introductory programs (e.g., hello world), with build/run instructions
– more complex example programs, with build/run instructions
– tabular comparison of characteristics and features, with respect to other (representative) languages
• Build your site.
You don’t need to submit your website. I will grade it in place.
Hints and Advice
Choose a language that no one on your team already knows well. Rather, choose a language that you and your teammates would like to learn about. For example, any of the homework languages would have been acceptable: they are important languages, which you may have heard of, but they were (hopefully) new to you.
Consider choosing a language from the “sum” examples, in our pub directory.
Choose a language for which you can obtain a translator. It does not have to run on the onyx cluster, but you will need to develop and demonstrate example programs. I can help build/install translators on the onyx cluster.
Develop your own examples. Do not just copy examples from the Internet. You are expected to learn the language. Each team member should develop several original examples.
